        I started my professional career when I was 16 years old in a forniture factory on 2012 wich I worked until 2014. Then I decided to go to Brazilian Army where I had a unique experience. On 2016 I returned to my first job thinking that was my path to follow and I worked until 2018.

        On 2020 I decided to go to college at Vale do Rio dos Sinos University where I finally changed completely my professional career. Systems Analysis and Development course approached a variety of concepts about the software development lifecycle and showed me a lot options to figure out and explore this huge world.
