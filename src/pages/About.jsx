      I started my professional career when I was 16 years old in a forniture factory on 2012 wich I worked until 2014. Then I decided to go to Brazilian Army where I had a unique experience. On 2016 I returned to my first job thinking that was my path to follow and I worked until 2018.<br />
      On 2019 I had an unique job opportunity abroad but &apos;doesn't&apos; worked because I don't have yet a good maturity.
      Returning to Brazil I decided to go to college on 2020 at Vale do Rio dos Sinos University where I finally changed completely my professional career. Systems Analysis and Delopment course approached a variety of concepts about the lifecycle of a software development and now I know that this is the path I want to follow.
